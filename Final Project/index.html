            <p>
                Birds of Paradise Sanctuary &amp; Rescue is dedicated to advocating for captive
                exotic birds and providing a permanent, loving home for the parrots in our care.

                Through education, rescue, and sanctuary, we work to give each bird a life
                filled with safety, enrichment, and respect.

            <h3>Why Your Help Matters</h3>
            <p>
                Caring for rescued parrots is a lifelong commitment. Many of the birds at
                Birds of Paradise Sanctuary &amp; Rescue cannot be adopted out and will spend
                the rest of their lives at the sanctuary.
            </p>
            <p>Your support helps provide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fresh food and clean water</strong> every single day</li>
                <li><strong>Veterinary care</strong> for chronic health issues and emergencies</li>
                <li><strong>Enrichment and toys</strong> that keep intelligent birds mentally active</li>
                <li><strong>Safe aviaries and perches</strong> designed for climbing and flying</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Every sponsorship, donation, and share of our mission makes a direct difference
                in the quality of life for the parrots who depend on us.
